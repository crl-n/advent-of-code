# Advent of Code
These are my solutions for all years of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).
I've used various languages for various years, although mainly Kotlin, Go, Javascript and Python.
There's a directory for each year. Each year's solutions might be organized slightly differently.

No inputs included [as requested by the author of Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about).
