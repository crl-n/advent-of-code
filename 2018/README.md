# Advent of Code 2018
Solved with Java 23. Each exercise part is a self-contained program. 

## Run
For code to run you have to enable Java preview features.
You can do this by passing a flag to `java`:
```shell
java --enable-preview 01/Day01PartA.java
```

If running more than one program, you may prefer to use the
`JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS` environment variable instead:
```shell
export JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS='--enable-preview'
```
Less typing that way.
